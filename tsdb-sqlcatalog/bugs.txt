TSDB SQLCatalog Plugin
Whitehead, 2014
On The Fly Bug List
===================================
5/29/2014:
	* File based (fully persisted) H2 DB: Sequences jump huge values on JVM recycle
	* For fully persisted DB, TSD_* tables get AK violation for legit new XUID but with existing name.
		e.g.  
		t0: XUID: 000003, NAME: combined
		followed on a later instance
		t5: XUID: 000078, NAME: combined
		Only an issue if baseline HBase instance changes or is reset.
	* Auto Enable/Disable Text Search, JMX Enable/Disable, Remoting Enable/Disable
	* TSDB Plugin Support Classpath
		Refine impl: scan directories for jars, support simple class directories
		Print contents on load
	* Need to handle meta deletes (trigger store into deleted table)
